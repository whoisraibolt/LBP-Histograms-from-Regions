# LBP Histograms from Regions

A year ago I've been trying to play the LBP feature histograms extracted from regions.

Honestly, I do not remember/I have no idea how the code is but I believe there is still a lot to do with it.

## Overview

An attempt to reproduce the LBP feature histograms extracted from regions in Python.

## Dependencies

- PIL
- skimage
- cv2
- glob
- os
- matplotlib
- numpy

You can install missing dependencies with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/ "pip"). And install TensorFlow via [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/ "TensorFlow") link.

## Usage

1. Install the dependencies;
2. Run Jupyter Notebook in terminal to see the code in your browser.
